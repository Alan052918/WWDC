## Thank You üéâ

Last years [WWDC Session Notes](https://github.com/Blackjacx/WWDC/tree/2019) was so successful that I decided to continue this form of WWDC session summary. I would like to take the moment to thank all of you for contribution, feedback, support and reading my session notes üôè

## Intro

Usually it is much faster to read through some bullet points instead of watching a 50 min session video. Then if you find something interesting you can still watch it.

Sessions that are exceptionally mentionable are highlighted using a ‚òÖ.

> This is work in progress since it is a lot of effort to watch all the videos by myself. So either please be patient or just [open up an issue](https://github.com/Blackjacx/WWDC/issues/new) to make a suggestion which session notes you like to see next :)

## Contribution

Feel free to submit a `PR` if I got something wrong or you have a suggestion for improvement. Please also have a look in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to contribute.

Thanks so much to EVERYBODY who contributed and improved the overall quality of the notes and those who added complete notes to the list:

## What's new in Swift

https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10170/

_Ted Kremenek, Kyle Macomber_

- **Swift Releases**
  - Xcode 11.4 - Swift 5.2
  - Xcode 12 (beta) - Swift 5.3

- **Runtime Performance**
  - Code Size
    - Code size is the part of the app that represnts the machine code representation of the app's logic
    - Swift 5.3 is below 1.5 times the code size of Objective-C version (based on app that ships with iOS)
    - Size difference is inevitable because of Swift safety features
    - SwiftUI app binary code size can be reduced by 40% (based on MoviesSwiftUI app)
  - Memory Layout
    - Comparing models with three properties in Obj-C (`NSUUID`, `NSString` and `float`) and Swift (`UUID`, `String`, `Float`)
    - In Obj-C object variables are just pointers which then hold pointer to ther properties
    - Swift's use of value types avoid the need to access values via pointers (UUID and Strings)
    - Significant memory benefit because it is allocated directly within array storage (contiguous block of memory)
    - Heap memory use comparison: 20kB in Swift 5.1 vs 35kB in Obj-C (400 models in array)
    - Swift's Standard Library now is below Foundation in the Stack

- **Diagnostics**
  - New diagnostics in the Swift compiler result in more precise and actionable errors
  - Additional notes in error messages (SwiftUI as an example)
  - More info on [swift.org](https://swift.org/blog/new-diagnostic-arch-overview/)

- **Code completion**
  - Much better code completion thanks to improvements in SourceKit
  - Code completion for dictionary literals, ternarry expressions and more dynamic features like keypaths
  - Code completion in Xcode 12.0 is 15x faster compared to Xcode 11.5

- **Code Indentation**
  - Improved indentation formating in chained methods calls, tuples, multiline `if` and `guards`
  - Improved indentation in SwiftUI as well

- **Debugging**
  - Debugger now displays the reason for Swift runtime failure traps

- **Cross-Platform Support**
  - Multiple platform support
    - Apple Platforms
    - Ubuntu 16.04, 18.04, 20.04
    - CentOS 8
    - Amazon Linux 2
    - Windows (coming soon)
  - Swift on AWS Lambda
    - Runtime is open-source and is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/swift-server/swift-aws-lambda-runtime/)

- **Language**
  - [Swift Evolution website](https://apple.github.io/swift-evolution/)
  - Multiple trailing closure syntax [SE-0279](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0279-multiple-trailing-closures.md)
    - It's important to set the correct base name of the method that will indicate the first trailing closure that its label will be dropped
  - Key Path Expressions as Functions [SE-0249](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0249-key-path-literal-function-expressions.md)
  - `@main`: Type-Based Program Entry Points [SE-0281](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0281-main-attribute.md)
    - The standarized way to delegate a program's entry point
  - Increased availability of implicit self in @escaping closures when reference cycles are unlikely to occur [SE-0269](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0269-implicit-self-explicit-capture.md)
    - Now it's possible to add `self` to the capture list
    - In Swift 5.3, if self is a structure it can be omitted entirely from the closure
  - Multi-Pattern Catch Clauses [SE-0276](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0276-multi-pattern-catch-clauses.md)
  - Enum Enhancements
    - `Comparable` conformance is now synthsized automatically [SE-0266](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0266-synthesized-comparable-for-enumerations.md)
    - Enum cases as protocol witnesses [SE-0280](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0280-enum-cases-as-protocol-witnesses.md)
  - Embedded DSL Enhancements
    - Builder closures
    - Swift 5.3 introduces pattern matching statements like `if let` and `switch`
    - Builder inference (`@SceneBuilder` is not longer needed)

- **Libraries**
  - `Float16` [SE-0277](https://github.com/apple/swift-evolution/blob/master/proposals/0277-float16.md)
    - Half-width floating point type
