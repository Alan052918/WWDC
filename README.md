## Thank You üéâ

Last years [WWDC Session Notes](https://github.com/Blackjacx/WWDC/tree/2019) was so successful that I decided to continue this form of WWDC session summary. I would like to take the moment to thank all of you for contribution, feedback, support and reading my session notes üôè

## Intro

Usually it is much faster to read through some bullet points instead of watching a 50 min session video. Then if you find something interesting you can still watch it.

Sessions that are exceptionally mentionable are highlighted using a ‚òÖ.

> This is work in progress since it is a lot of effort to watch all the videos by myself. So either please be patient or just [open up an issue](https://github.com/Blackjacx/WWDC/issues/new) to make a suggestion which session notes you like to see next :)

## Contribution

Feel free to submit a `PR` if I got something wrong or you have a suggestion for improvement. Please also have a look in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you want to contribute.

Thanks so much to EVERYBODY who contributed and improved the overall quality of the notes and those who added complete notes to the list:
