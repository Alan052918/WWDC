## Introducing Car Keys

https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10006

Presenter: _Matthias Lerch_

- **People can unlock, lock and start their car (iPhone or Apple Watch)**
- **Stored securely** on the device and can be deleted via iCloud
- **Keys can be shared with the family or friends**
- Agnostic to radio technology (**supports NFC so far**)
- **Offline capable**
- **Car needs to support owner pairing, transactions and server interfaces**
  - **Owner pairing** (association if iPhone and car)
    - Prove ownership of car
    - Initiate pairing
    - Place iPhone near car's NFC reader
    - Car key appears in Wallet
  - **Transactions** (unlock, lock, start the car)
    - NFC readers in door handle and dashboard (engine start)
    - Optimized for security and performance
    - Express mode lets the feature work without Face ID or passcode (turned on by default)
    - iPhone and car can be offline
    - Apple doesn't know when you use your car
  - **Server Interfaces** (key sharing, key management)
    - Share keys over Messages
    - Car can be offline when sharing
    - Apple doesn't know who you share your car key with
    - Optional access levels (e.g. 'Unlock and Drive', 'Access and drive up to 65 mph')
    - It's up to each auto maker to define access levels
- **Key management**
  - Manage owner and shared keys from iPhone or car
  - Keys removed from a device stop working immediately (even if the device is offline)
  - Easy to change owner device (e.g. when buying a new iPhone)
- **System architecture**
  - Fully integrated into iOS natively
  - Keys created and stored in Secure Elements and never exported
  - All features use AES and eliptic-curve cryptography
  - Offline design based on PKI
  - Automaker TSM (Trusted Service Manager) not required for simple server integration
  - **What is a digital car key?**
    - Binded to the user's device and not to Apple or auto makers
    - Private key (SK) never leaves SE (Secure Element)
    - Public key is exported in an X.509 certificate for verification
    - **Applet**
      - Implements the car key in the Secure Element
      - Stores key pair, car public key, secure mailboxes
      - All car keys hosted in a single applet instance
    - **Owner pairing flow (online)**
      1. PAKE Verifier
      2. Pairing password
      3. Pairing
      4. Cryptographic linking
      5. Key activation/registration
      6. Key attestation
    - **Key sharing flow**
      1. Owner sends invitation using Messages
      2. New key crated in
      3. Identity certificate chain
      4. Owner verification
      5. Attestation returned
      6. Offline registration
    - **Lifecycle of a car key**
      - Created during owner pairing or key sharing
      - Transactions
      - Suspensions
      - Revocation
      - Deletion
    - **Certificates and Transaction**
      - Owner sharing, key sharing, fast and standard transactions
      - Take a deeper look at the presented flows and schemes in [the session](https://developer.apple.com/videos/play/wwdc2020/10006/) (timecode is 11:30)
- **Radio technologies**
  - **NFC**
    - Based on standard NFC reader
    - Enhanced Contactless Protocol (ECP)
    - Enables a fully automatic NFC experience
    - Identifiers available before transaction starts (Reader type, Automaker)
    - Efficient reader polling
  - **Ultra Wideband**
    - iPhone with U1 chip
    - Use with iPhone in bag or pocket
    - Common key management architecture
    - Specification is currently in development
- **Server integration**
  - Required for remote key management
  - Auto maker server needs to establish connection to Apple's backend (for each environment, e.g. testing and production)
  - Exchange certificates
  - Implement and test server interfaces (register a new key, revoke keys, send notifications)
  - Provide artwork
  - Connect to automaker app
- **Automaker apps**
  - Provide custom features using keys stored in Wallet
  - Start owner pairing
  - Available to automakers
  - Entitlement is required
  - Use PassKit APIs
- **How to get started (for auto makers)**
  - Car Connectivity Consortium
  - Digital Key Specification 2.0
  - Digital Key Specification 3.0 (in development, will support Ultra Wideband)
