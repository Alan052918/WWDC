## What's new in Universal Links

Presenters: _Christopher Linn_

- **Universal Links**
  - HTTPS URLs that represent your content both on the web and in your app
  - Allow to open your app instead of browser
  - Enable by adding an entitlement to your app and a JSON file to your web server - creates secure association between both
  - Custom URL schemes not recommended anymore - switch as soon as possible
- **Support for watchOS**
  - Same functionalities like on iOS, tvOS and macOS
  - Apply entitlement to your WatchKit extension - not your WatchKit App
  - Use `[WKExtensionDelegate.handle(_ userActivity: NSUserActivity) -> Void](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkextensiondelegate/2798966-handle)` to handle Universal Links
  - Use `[WKExtension.shared().openSystemURL(url)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/watchkit/wkextension/1628224-opensystemurl)` to open Universal Links in other apps
  - Different API on iOS (UIKit) and macOS (AppKit)
- **Universal Links in SwiftUI**
  - Now it is possible to handle Universal Links equally on all platforms
  - Handle Universal Links using `.onOpenURL { url in /* ... */ }`
  - Open Universal Links in other apps using `@Environment (\.openURL) var openURL; let url = /* ... */; openURL(url)`
- **Enhanced Pattern Matching**
  - `*` matches zero or more characters greedily
  - `?` matches any one character
  - `*?` matches at least one character
  - `"components": [{ "/": "/sourdough/?*", "caseSensitive": false }]` for case-insensitive pattern matching (macOS Catalina 10.15.5 and iOS 13.5)
  - `"components": [{ "/": "/中國哲學書電子化計劃/?*", "percentEncoded": false }]` for Unicode pattern matching (macOS Big Sur and iOS 14)
  - `"defaults": { "percentEncoded": false, "caseSensitive": false }` to specify defaults for all components (macOS Big Sur and iOS 14)
    - Apply `defaults` to "details" (includes app IDs and components) or only to "components" to match all elements of the respective arrays
- **Substitution Variables**
  - Named lists of substrings to match against
  - Names can contain anything but `$`, `(`, `)`
  - Names are always case sensitive in patterns
  - Values can contain `?` and `*` but no other substitution variables
  - Values are case-sensitive by default
  - Available today in macOS Catalina 10.15.6 and iOS 13.5
  - **Predefined Substitution Variables**
    - `$(alpha)* - match upper and lower case letters`
    - `$(upper),$(lower)* - match either upper or lower case letters`
    - `$(alnum)* - match upper and lower case letters including digits`
    - `$(digit),$(xdigit)* - match either digits or hexadecimal digits`
    - `$(region)** - match every ISO region code defined by Foundation: Locale.isoRegionCodes`
    - `$(lang)** - match every ISO language code defined by Foundation: Locale.isoLanguageCodes`
    - Use `"exclude": true` to exclude specific patterns
    - Substitution variables can be used to form different combinations of patterns, e.g. show different menus for different countries
    - **Example**
      ```json
      {
        "appLinks": {
          "substitutionVariables": {
            "food": [ "burrito", "sushi" ],
            "Canadian food": [ "burrito", "poutine", "tête-de-violon" ]
          },
          "details": [{
            "appIDs": [ "ABCDEF.com..example.restaurant" ],
            "components": [
              { "/": "$(lang)_CA/$(Canadian food)/", "percentEncoded": false }
              { "/": "$(lang)_CA/$(food)/", "exclude": true }
              { "/": "$(lang)_$(region)/$(food)/" }
            ]
          }]
        }
      }
      ```
- **Universal Links Workflow** 
  - After download of an app the system checks its entitlements to see if it needs any app-association files, and downloads them
  - App association files can now be downloaded in parallel by connecting to an **Apple CDN** instead of opening one connection per downloaded app
    - CDN is dedicated to associated domains
    - CDN uses single HTTP/2 connection for all associated domains on a device
    - CDN Reduces load on your server
    - CDN routes devices to a known-good, known-fast connection
  - **Alternate Modes** for internal domains not reachable from an Apple CDN
    - **Managed Mode** when distributing within your organization (see [What's New in Managing Apple Devices (WWDC20)](https://developer.apple.com/wwdc20/10639))
      - System trusted root certificate
      - MDN admin must opt-in
      - Works using any profile
    - **Developer Mode** when building your app
      - Use any SSL certificate
      - User must opt-in from `iOS Settings > Developer > Associated Domains Development` or for macOS using the command `swcutil developer-mode -e true`
      - Only works using a development profile
    - Server path for all modes: `https://example.com/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`
    - Specify domains for different modes in the entitlements as `<string>applinks:testing.example.com?mode=developer</string>` (or `?mode=managed` or `?mode=developer+managed`) in an array under the key `com.apple.developer.associated-domains`
