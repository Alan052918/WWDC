- **Symptoms**
  - Developers can now track symptoms in HealthKit, read and write symptom samples
  - HealthKit attempted to cover and track a wide range of symptoms (shortness of breath, sleep changes, appetite changes, fever, headache, etc)
  - There are 13 symptom data types in HealthKit
- **Electrocardiogram (ECG)**
  - ECG samples will be available for reading in the latest version of iOS and watchOS
  - An ECG sample can be read as an [`HKElectrocardiogram`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkelectrocardiogram) (it represents a waveform as a series of voltage values)
  - ECG sample has important properties that describe the measurements
  - [classification (`HKElectrocardiogram.Classification`)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkelectrocardiogram/3551981-classification)
    - Apple Watch will give the result of the recording in the form of a classification
    - The classification is divided into 2 types
      - Sinus Rhithm (heart is beating in a uniform pattern)
      - Atrial fibrillation (form of irregular rhythm, user should probably go see their doctor)
    - If Apple Watch is unable to determine the ECG result, either due to a low or a high heart rate or due to any other reason, the result is considered inconclusive
  - [symptomStatus (`HKElectrocardiogram.SymptomsStatus`)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkelectrocardiogram/3551984-symptomsstatus)
    - It tells if the user associated a symptom with this ECG (e.g. heartburn, tightness in the chest)
    - The symptom experienced can be recorded along with the ECG
  - [averageHeartRage (`HKQuantity?`)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkelectrocardiogram/3551980-averageheartrate)
  - [samplingFrequence (`HKQuantity?`)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkelectrocardiogram/3551983-samplingfrequency)
  - [numberOfVoltageMeasurements (`Int`)](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkelectrocardiogram/3551982-numberofvoltagemeasurements)
    - It refers to the individual voltage measurements that make up an ECG sample
- **[`HKElectrocardiogramQuery`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkelectrocardiogramquery)**
  - To retrieve the individual measurements run the [`HKElectrocardiogramQuery`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkelectrocardiogramquery)
  - Fetch the ECG samples with any of the HealthKit queries and then initialize the [`HKElectrocardiogramQuery`](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/healthkit/hkelectrocardiogramquery) with the fetched sample
  - When this query is executed on the HealthStore, you get the individual voltage measurements back in the ECG and the data handler
- **Mobility**
  - **New set of mobility types** (available for reading and writing on the latest iOS and watchOS)
    - Walking speed and step length
    - Walking assymetry and double support percentage
    - Stair ascent and descent speed
    - Six-minute walk test distance
